# Abandoned

This is a biography describing one woman's childhood struggles while growing up in Chicago.

# Plot outline

A young girl, a daughter of a prostitute, tries to survive living with her abusive mother. She survives physical, mental, and sexual abuse. She finds refuge in books and in brief interactions with animals. She nearly becomes a spelling bee representative for her primary school only to have that dream crushed by her mother. She eventually turns to violence and hangs out with gang members. Gun fights between gangs are paused just to allow her safe passage. Eventually, her early childhood struggles culminate with the most brutal yet physical fight with her mother. She runs away from home and finds refuge in a Christian community which turns out to be a cult. Her struggles continue, however this time due to mostly psychological abuse. Throughout, she becomes homeless twice but eventually becomes an independent woman who is passionate about helping animals, owns a small business, but still struggles to sleep through the night due to memories of her past.

# How you can help

I always appreciate people helping me with grammatical and other errors but that's not the only way you can contribute. Here are more ways you can help:

* Share on Twitter, Facebook, or elsewhere.
* Watch, star or fork this repo. You don't need to do anything else. for the time being, but it will help me achieve some visibility.
* You can interact with the text and the rest directly from the web: you can comment on text and changes in it (called commits).
* You can also request changes on the text using issues. If you find an error of any kind, just raise an issue and I'll fix it (or try to).
* You can create your own versions, fork, branch, extend with your own memories of childhood struggles, draw parallels, or share contrasting examples.
* Check out the TODO list in case you find something that you could do yourself.

# Purpose

This is a real story. I hope that it helps to grow awareness of struggles that some children have to live through. I also hope that other children (and adults) who might be experiencing similar abuse will come to understand that it is not normal and will seek help. When I lived through my story, I did not realize that I was being abused.
